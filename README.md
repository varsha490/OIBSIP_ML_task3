# 🚗 OIBSIP ML Internship – Task 3: Car Price Prediction

This project is part of the **Oasis Infobyte Machine Learning Internship (Task 3)**.  
The goal of this task is to build a **Car Price Prediction Model** that estimates the resale price of cars using Machine Learning techniques.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The price of a car depends on several factors such as:
- Brand and goodwill  
- Year of manufacture  
- Present price  
- Kilometers driven  
- Fuel type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)  
- Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)  
- Owner history  

This project uses **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** to predict the price of used cars.
